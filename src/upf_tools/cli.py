"""Command line interface for :mod:`upf_tools`.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in ``__main__``? You might be tempted to import things from ``__main__``
later, but that will cause problems--the code will get executed twice:

- When you run ``python3 -m upf_tools`` python will execute``__main__.py`` as a script.
  That means there won't be any ``upf_tools.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
- When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
  there's no ``upf_tools.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
